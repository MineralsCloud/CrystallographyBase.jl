# CrystallographyBase

Documentation for [CrystallographyBase](https://github.com/MineralsCloud/CrystallographyBase.jl).

See the [Index](@ref main-index) for the complete list of documented functions
and types.

The code, which is [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/MineralsCloud/CrystallographyBase.jl), is tested
using various continuous integration services for its validity.

This repository is created and maintained by
[@singularitti](https://github.com/singularitti), and contributions are highly welcome.

## Package features

- Define crystal lattices and cells
- Compute reciprocal lattices
- Generate supercells and k-point grids
- Enable math utilities for crystal properties

## Installation

The package can be installed with the Julia package manager.
From [the Julia REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/), type `]` to enter
the [Pkg mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/#Pkg-mode) and run:

```julia-repl
pkg> add CrystallographyBase
```

Or, equivalently, via [`Pkg.jl`](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/):

```@repl
import Pkg; Pkg.add("CrystallographyBase")
```
